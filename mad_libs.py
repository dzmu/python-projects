I scoured my closet for the perfect {Article_of_Clothing} to wear. Dressing for the most {Adjective} place
around isn’t easy. Sweating {Plural_Noun} during the interview is a sure sign of weakness. I must
remember to play up my strengths: {Sport}, menacing stares, and {Noun} collecting.
It has always been my dream to work with the Angel of Coding, or {Adjective2} Developer. The power
and prestige are {Adverb} desirable.
The Gates of {Proper_Noun} tower above me as I ring the doorbell. I can’t believe {Song_Title} is
the doorbell chime. {Interjection}, his unicorn {Clothing} looks better in person!
